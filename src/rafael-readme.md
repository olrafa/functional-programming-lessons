Hello Rein, Arien,

I had two issues in this homework. First, I still don't have the async things very clear on my head, so I struggled a bit until I got two out of three tests of the async functions correct.

Because of that, I had problems with the tranforming tests as well. I tried to 'start with the end in mind', and went straigth to the final reduce, hoping it would cover the entire thing. It worked for the final object but not for the previous tests. I spent a while trying to fix it, couldn't get it to work, and moved to the async, which took me more time and mental space than I expected.

Afterwards, I spent a couple of hours trying to rewrite it, unsuccessfully. I am now completely beat and can't think anymore, but I am sure I would be able to do it if there was no time limit. I felt I should state this, and attach this message to my project.

Have a great week,
Rafael
